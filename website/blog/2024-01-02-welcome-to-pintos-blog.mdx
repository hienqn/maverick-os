Welcome to the PintOS Blog! We've restructured our content into bite-sized, interactive blog posts to make learning operating systems more engaging.

{/* truncate */}

## What You'll Find Here

Our blog posts cover core computer science and operating system concepts, always tied back to real code in the PintOS kernel:

- **OS Concepts**: Virtual memory, scheduling, synchronization, file systems
- **Data Structures**: Hash tables, linked lists, bitmaps used in kernels
- **Algorithms**: Page replacement, disk scheduling, deadlock detection
- **Systems Programming**: C programming patterns, assembly, debugging techniques
- **PintOS Projects**: Deep dives into each project's implementation

## Concept Map: How It All Connects

## Interactive Learning

Every post includes interactive elements to reinforce understanding:

      explanation: 'Our blog posts feature interactive components like memory layouts, animated diagrams, code walkthroughs, and quizzes - all connected to actual PintOS implementation.',
    },
    {
      question: 'Which programming language is PintOS written in?',
      options: [
        { text: 'Rust', isCorrect: false },
        { text: 'C++', isCorrect: false },
        { text: 'C', isCorrect: true },
        { text: 'Assembly only', isCorrect: false },
      ],
      explanation: 'PintOS is written primarily in C with some x86 assembly for low-level operations like context switching and interrupt handling.',

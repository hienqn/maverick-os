An operating system is software that manages computer hardware and provides services for programs. But what does that actually mean?

{/* truncate */}

## The Big Picture

When you run a program on your computer, it doesn't talk directly to the hardware. Instead, the operating system acts as an intermediary:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           User Applications             │
│      (browser, editor, games...)        │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Operating System              │
│   (process management, memory, I/O)     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              Hardware                   │
│      (CPU, RAM, disk, network...)       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The OS provides two essential functions:

1. **Abstraction** - Hide hardware complexity behind simple interfaces
2. **Multiplexing** - Share limited resources among multiple programs

## What the OS Manages

### CPU Management

Your computer might have 4 CPU cores but run 200 processes. The OS **scheduler** decides which process gets CPU time and for how long. It switches between processes so fast (thousands of times per second) that they appear to run simultaneously.

### Memory Management

Each process thinks it has the entire memory to itself. The OS uses **virtual memory** to create this illusion, mapping each process's virtual addresses to physical RAM:

<MemoryLayout
  title="Virtual vs Physical Memory"
  regions={[
    { name: 'Process A (virtual)', start: '0x00000000', end: '0xFFFFFFFF', color: '#3b82f6', description: 'Process A sees full 4GB address space' },
    { name: 'Process B (virtual)', start: '0x00000000', end: '0xFFFFFFFF', color: '#22c55e', description: 'Process B also sees full 4GB address space' },
  ]}
/>

Both processes have address `0x00001000`, but the OS maps them to different physical memory locations. Neither can access the other's memory.

### File Systems

The OS organizes raw disk blocks into files and directories. When you call `open("document.txt")`, the OS:
1. Looks up the file in directory structures
2. Checks if you have permission
3. Returns a file descriptor for subsequent reads/writes

### Device I/O

Hardware devices are complex and varied. The OS provides uniform interfaces - you read from a keyboard the same way you read from a network socket.

## User Mode vs Kernel Mode

The CPU has (at least) two privilege levels:

| Mode | Can Access | Used By |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **Kernel mode** | Everything - all memory, all instructions | Operating system |
| **User mode** | Restricted - only its own memory | Applications |

When a program needs OS services (like reading a file), it makes a **system call**. This safely transfers control to the kernel:

```
User Program          Kernel
     │                  │
     │  syscall(read)   │
     │─────────────────>│
     │                  │ (validates, performs I/O)
     │    result        │
     │<─────────────────│
     │                  │
```

## Why Study Operating Systems?

Understanding the OS helps you:
- Write faster, more efficient programs
- Debug mysterious performance issues
- Understand security vulnerabilities
- Appreciate the abstractions you use daily

In MaverickOS (our PintOS fork), you'll implement these concepts yourself: a thread scheduler, virtual memory, and a file system.
